# = InboundOrder
# This model represents an order that inputs items into our inventory.
# It has three states:
#   * 'pending':   The initial state.
#   * 'received':  The items in the order which we'll add to our inventory are fully registered.
#   * 'completed': The items in the order are stored in shelves, and are now part of our inventory.
